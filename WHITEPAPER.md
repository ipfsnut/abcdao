# ABC DAO WHITEPAPER
## Ship Code, Earn Rewards - The Live Action Developer Game for Farcaster

---

## ABSTRACT

ABC DAO gamifies open-source development by rewarding developers who ship code with $ABC tokens and social recognition on Farcaster. By combining staking mechanics with automatic commit recognition, ABC creates a sustainable ecosystem where developers are incentivized to build in public while earning crypto rewards and growing their reputation.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Building in public should be rewarded. ABC DAO transforms everyday coding into a game where developers earn $ABC tokens and Farcaster recognition simply by shipping code. No grant applications, no complex scoring - just stake your tokens and let your commits do the talking.

Our philosophy: **Ship code, get rewards.** Every commit counts. Every push gets recognized. Every developer wins.

## 2. TOKENOMICS

- **Token**: $ABC (v4 Clanker token)
- **Network**: Base Mainnet  
- **Supply**: 100,000,000,000 $ABC (100B total supply)

### Fee Distribution Model

**Clanker Trading Fees ($WETH + $ABC)**:
- **50%** â†’ Dev wallet (primary treasury/collector)
- **50%** â†’ Bot wallet â†’ Auto-unwrapped â†’ Staking contract â†’ Distributed to stakers

**Membership Fees ($ETH)**:
- **100%** â†’ Bot wallet â†’ Staking contract â†’ Distributed to stakers

**Developer Rewards ($ABC)**:
- Funded from Bot wallet's portion of $ABC trading fees
- Random rewards (50,000-1,000,000 $ABC per commit)

### Dual Reward System
- **Stakers**: Earn $ETH from 50% of Clanker trading fees + 100% of membership fees
- **Developers**: Earn $ABC tokens for commits (funded from Bot wallet's trading fee portion)
- **Dev Wallet**: Holds 50% of all Clanker trading fees as primary treasury reserves

## 3. THE DEVELOPER GAME

### How to Play
1. **Join ABC DAO**: Pay 0.002 ETH membership fee to bot wallet
2. **Link GitHub**: Connect your GitHub account via Farcaster miniapp
3. **Buy $ABC**: Purchase tokens on Base (Clanker v4 token)
4. **Stake tokens**: Lock $ABC to unlock commit rewards
5. **Ship code**: Code normally - all public commits count
6. **Earn rewards**: Get $ABC for commits + ETH from staking

### Staking Benefits
- Unlock commit rewards (must be staked to earn)
- **Earn $ETH from 50% of Clanker trading fees** (primary reward stream)
- **Earn $ETH from 100% of membership fees** (secondary reward stream)
- Automatic WETH unwrapping for seamless reward distribution
- Higher stake = higher commit rewards
- Build reputation on Farcaster
- No governance - just ship and earn

## 4. COMMIT RECOGNITION SYSTEM

### The ABC Bot
- **Platform**: Farcaster account powered by Neynar API
- **Function**: Monitors GitHub commits from registered developers
- **Action**: Posts achievement casts and distributes rewards

### Recognition Flow
1. Registered Developer makes a commit to any public repo
2. ABC Bot detects the commit via GitHub webhooks
3. Bot verifies developer has minimum $ABC staked (requirement may vary)
4. Bot posts cast celebrating the commit
5. $ABC rewards distributed automatically

### Reward Formula
- Simple: 1 commit = 1 reward
- Random reward amounts (50,000 to 1,000,000 $ABC)
- Must have minimum stake to qualify
- Daily cap: 10 commits max per developer
- All public repo commits count equally

## 5. REWARD DISTRIBUTION

### Developer Rewards
- Funded by $ABC from Bot wallet's 50% share of trading fees
- Random rewards between 50,000-1,000,000 $ABC per commit
- Fully automated - no manual intervention
- Sustainable through continuous fee generation

### Staker Rewards
- $ETH from Bot wallet's 50% share of Clanker trading fees (WETH auto-unwrapped)
- $ETH from 100% of membership fees
- Claim anytime from staking contract
- Compounds with more stakers joining

### Treasury Reserves
- Dev wallet holds 50% of all Clanker trading fees ($WETH + $ABC)
- Primary treasury for long-term project sustainability
- Separate from operational Bot wallet distributions

- **Process**: Pay bot wallet â†’ Submit transaction hash â†’ Backend verification
- **Benefits**: Lifetime membership + GitHub commit rewards eligibility
- **Revenue Flow**: ETH to staking contract for rewards distribution

### Backend Services

4. **Membership Processor**: Verifies 0.002 ETH payments to bot wallet
5. **Fee Splitter**: Distributes 50% of Clanker fees to Dev wallet, 50% to Bot wallet
6. **Reward Distributor**: Sends $ABC from Bot wallet's portion for commits
7. **WETH Unwrapper**: Automatically converts WETH to ETH for reward distribution

## 8. CONCLUSION

ABC DAO strips Web3 devrel to its essential elements: **ship code, earn rewards**. By focusing on the Farcaster community and maintaining radical simplicity, we create a sustainable funding mechanism for the builders who will define the future of decentralized social networks.

The best DAOs don't need complex mechanisms. They need clear purpose, aligned incentives, and committed communities. ABC DAO provides exactly thatâ€”nothing more, nothing less.
