# ABC DAO WHITEPAPER
## The Simplest Community Grants DAO

---

## ABSTRACT

ABC DAO represents a minimalist approach to decentralized governance and community funding. By combining straightforward tokenomics with democratic voting mechanisms, ABC creates a sustainable treasury that empowers the Farcaster community to support emerging developers and builders through grants.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The Web3 ecosystem thrives on innovation from independent developers and small teams. However, accessing funding remains a significant barrier. ABC DAO addresses this by creating a self-sustaining grant system powered by trading fees and governed by token holders.

Our philosophy: **Keep it simple.** No complex mechanics. No unnecessary features. Just stake, vote, and distribute grants to those who deserve them.

## 2. TOKENOMICS

- **Token**: $ABC
- **Network**: Base Mainnet  
- **Supply**: [TBD - Fixed supply with no inflation]

### Trading Fee Distribution
- $ETH from trading fees → Distributed to stakers
- $ABC from trading fees → DAO Treasury
- Fees automatically routed to staking contract
- No manual intervention required

## 3. STAKING MECHANISM

### How It Works
1. Users purchase $ABC tokens
2. Token holders stake $ABC at abc.epicdylan.com
3. Staked tokens grant voting power (1 $ABC = 1 vote)
4. Stakers can unstake at any time (subject to cooldown period)

### Benefits of Staking
- Earn $ETH from trading fees
- Governance participation rights
- Influence over grant distributions
- Building the Farcaster ecosystem
- Supporting emerging developers

## 4. GOVERNANCE SYSTEM

### Proposal Process
1. Any staker can nominate grant recipients
2. Nominations require minimum stake threshold
3. Voting period: 7 days
4. Simple majority wins (>50% of votes cast)
5. Executed on-chain automatically

### Voting Power
- Proportional to staked $ABC
- No vote delegation (keep it simple)
- No quadratic voting (1 token = 1 vote)
- Votes are binding and executed programmatically

## 5. GRANT DISTRIBUTION

### Target Recipients
- Farcaster protocol developers
- Frame builders and innovators
- Infrastructure providers
- Community tool creators
- Educational content creators
- Up-and-coming developers who demonstrate commitment

### Grant Criteria
- Clear value proposition for Farcaster ecosystem
- Demonstrated track record or strong potential
- Open-source contributions preferred
- Community benefit over individual gain

### Distribution Mechanism
- Grants paid in $ABC from treasury
- Multiple grants can be approved per voting cycle
- No grant size limits (community decides)
- Transparent on-chain execution

## 6. TREASURY MANAGEMENT

### Revenue Sources
- $ABC from trading fees accumulates in treasury
- Only $ABC enters treasury (ETH goes to stakers)

### Treasury Rules
- No access except through governance votes
- Grants paid out in $ABC
- Cannot exceed distribution rate that depletes principal
- Emergency pause function (requiring 75% supermajority)
- Full transparency via on-chain verification

## 7. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Smart Contracts
1. **Token Contract**: Standard ERC-20 for $ABC
2. **Staking Contract**: Handles deposits, withdrawals, and fee collection
3. **Governance Contract**: Manages proposals and voting
4. **Treasury Contract**: Holds and distributes funds

### Security Measures
- Audited smart contracts
- Time-locks on critical functions
- Multi-sig for emergency controls
- No admin keys for normal operations

## 8. LAUNCH STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Contract Development
- Deploy and test smart contracts on Base
- Security audit completion

### Phase 2: Token Launch
- Fair launch mechanics (no pre-mine for team)
- Initial liquidity provision
- Trading activation

### Phase 3: Platform Launch
- Launch staking at abc.epicdylan.com
- Enable governance features
- First grant proposals

### Phase 4: Growth
- Increase liquidity depth
- Community marketing
- Partnership development

## 9. WHY ABC SUCCEEDS

### Simplicity First
- No complex tokenomics to understand
- Clear value proposition
- Easy participation

### Community Focused
- Farcaster-native from day one
- Supporting builders who matter
- Democratic decision-making

### Sustainable Model
- Trading fees create dual rewards: ETH for stakers, ABC for grants
- No reliance on emissions or inflation
- Self-perpetuating ecosystem growth

## 10. RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Low trading volume | Initial liquidity incentives, community engagement |
| Governance attacks | Minimum stake requirements, time-locks |
| Smart contract vulnerabilities | Professional audits, bug bounties |
| Voter apathy | Simple process, clear communication, tangible impact |

## 11. CONCLUSION

ABC DAO strips Web3 governance to its essential elements: **stake, vote, distribute**. By focusing on the Farcaster community and maintaining radical simplicity, we create a sustainable funding mechanism for the builders who will define the future of decentralized social networks.

The best DAOs don't need complex mechanisms. They need clear purpose, aligned incentives, and committed communities. ABC DAO provides exactly that—nothing more, nothing less.
