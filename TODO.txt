# NOTES

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account with admin access
- Farcaster account for testing
- Base mainnet wallet with ETH
- Domain name configured
- Basic understanding of smart contracts

## Execution Order
- Follow phases 1-12 sequentially for full launch
- Phase 13 is ongoing optimization after launch
- Dependencies: Must complete infrastructure before contracts, contracts before backend, etc.

## Budget Estimate
- Railway: $20-30/month
- Domain: $10-20/year
- Gas fees: 0.1-0.2 ETH
- Initial ABC liquidity: Variable
- Bot wallet funding: 10K ABC tokens initially (scale up after testing)
- Security tools: $0 (using free tiers)

## Security Approach (No Formal Audit)
Since traditional audits are expensive and time-consuming, we'll use:
- Free static analysis tools (Slither, MythX free tier)
- Manual code review and testing
- Gradual rollout with small amounts initially
- Community review (open source)
- Bug bounty program (small rewards)
- Conservative approach: test extensively before large deposits

## Risk Mitigation Without Audits
- Start with 10K ABC in bot wallet (not 100K+)
- Limit individual rewards to max 1K ABC initially
- Daily withdraw limits on treasury contract
- Multi-sig for emergency functions
- Pause mechanisms that can stop distributions
- Regular monitoring and manual intervention capability
- Clear communication to users about early-stage risks

## Team Requirements
- 1 developer (full-stack)
- Access to deployment infrastructure
- 2-4 hours daily during launch period
- On-call availability during launch week
