# ABC DAO WHITEPAPER
## Ship Code, Earn Rewards - The Live Action Developer Game for Farcaster

---

## ABSTRACT

ABC DAO gamifies open-source development by rewarding developers who ship code with $ABC tokens and social recognition on Farcaster. By combining staking mechanics with automatic commit recognition, ABC creates a sustainable ecosystem where developers are incentivized to build in public while earning crypto rewards and growing their reputation.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Building in public should be rewarded. ABC DAO transforms everyday coding into a game where developers earn $ABC tokens and Farcaster recognition simply by shipping code. No grant applications, no complex scoring - just stake your tokens and let your commits do the talking.

Our philosophy: **Ship code, get rewards.** Every commit counts. Every push gets recognized. Every developer wins.

## 2. TOKENOMICS

- **Token**: $ABC (v4 Clanker token)
- **Network**: Base Mainnet  
- **Supply**: 100,000,000,000 $ABC (100B total supply)

### Fee Distribution Model

**Clanker Trading Fees**:
- **$ETH portion** â†’ Staking contract â†’ Distributed to stakers
- **$ABC portion** â†’ Developer reward pool â†’ Distributed to developers for commits

**Membership Fees ($ETH)**:
- **100%** â†’ Staking contract â†’ Distributed to stakers

**Developer Rewards ($ABC)**:
- Funded from $ABC trading fees collected by protocol
- Random rewards (50,000-999,000 $ABC per commit)

### Dual Reward System
- **Stakers**: Earn $ETH from trading fees + 100% of membership fees
- **Developers**: Earn $ABC tokens from trading fees for commits
- **Clear Separation**: $ETH flows to stakers, $ABC flows to developers

## 3. THE DEVELOPER GAME

### How to Play
1. **Join ABC DAO**: Pay 0.002 ETH membership fee to protocol wallet
2. **Link GitHub**: Connect your GitHub account via Farcaster miniapp
3. **Buy $ABC**: Purchase tokens on Base (Clanker v4 token)
4. **Stake tokens**: Lock $ABC to unlock commit rewards
5. **Ship code**: Code normally - all public commits count
6. **Earn rewards**: Get $ABC for commits + ETH from staking

### Staking Benefits
- **Earn $ETH from Clanker trading fees** (primary reward stream)
- **Earn $ETH from 100% of membership fees** (secondary reward stream)  
- Automatic WETH unwrapping for seamless reward distribution
- Passive income from protocol fees
- Build reputation on Farcaster
- No governance - just stake and earn

## 4. COMMIT RECOGNITION SYSTEM

### The ABC DAO Bots
- **Platform**: Farcaster accounts powered by Neynar API
- **Function**: Monitor GitHub commits from registered developers
- **Action**: Post achievement casts and distribute rewards via @abc-dao-commits

### Recognition Flow
1. Registered Developer makes a commit to registered repository
2. ABC DAO backend detects the commit via GitHub webhooks
3. @abc-dao-commits posts cast celebrating the commit (tags Farcaster username)
4. $ABC rewards recorded in database for future claiming
5. Real-time processing and reward distribution

### Reward Formula
- Simple: 1 commit = 1 reward
- Random reward amounts (50,000 to 1,000,000 $ABC)
- Current phase: No staking requirement (all registered members eligible)
- Daily cap: 10 commits max per developer
- All public repo commits count equally
- Future phase: Staking requirement for enhanced rewards

## 5. REWARD DISTRIBUTION

### Developer Rewards
- Funded by $ABC trading fees collected by protocol
- Random rewards between 50,000-999,000 $ABC per commit
- Immediate cast announcements via @abc-dao-commits with commit URLs

- Automated reward distribution system
- Claimable via main ABC DAO application

### Staker Rewards
- $ETH from Clanker trading fees (WETH auto-unwrapped)
- $ETH from 100% of membership fees
- Claim anytime from staking contract

## 8. CONCLUSION

ABC DAO strips Web3 devrel to its essential elements: **ship code, earn rewards**. By focusing on the Farcaster community and maintaining radical simplicity, we create a sustainable funding mechanism for the builders who will define the future of decentralized social networks.

The best DAOs don't need complex mechanisms. They need clear purpose, aligned incentives, and committed communities. ABC DAO provides exactly thatâ€”nothing more, nothing less.

## Automated ETH Distribution

The ABC DAO protocol wallet automatically distributes incoming ETH every 6 hours according to the following allocation:

**Distribution Breakdown:**
- **25% â†’ Staking Contract** (`0x577822396162022654D5bDc9CB58018cB53e7017`) - Rewards for $ABC stakers
- **25% â†’ Treasury** (`0x18A85ad341b2D6A2bd67fbb104B4827B922a2A3c`) - Protocol development and maintenance
- **50% â†’ Protocol Operations** (`0xBE6525b767cA8D38d169C93C8120c0C0957388B8`) - Retained for gas, operations, and future distributions

**Automation Details:**
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC)
- **Minimum Threshold**: 0.01 ETH (prevents gas-inefficient micro-distributions)
- **Gas Reserve**: 0.005 ETH maintained for transaction fees
- **Transparency**: All distributions announced on Farcaster with transaction links

This automated system ensures sustainable funding for both staker rewards and community development while maintaining operational efficiency.
