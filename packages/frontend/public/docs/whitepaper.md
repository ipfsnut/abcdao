# ABC DAO WHITEPAPER
## Ship Code, Earn Rewards - The Developer Community for Web3 Builders

---

## ABSTRACT

ABC DAO creates a sustainable developer community where contributors earn $ABC tokens for their code commits while stakers earn ETH rewards from protocol activity. With wallet-first onboarding and automated reward distribution, ABC DAO simplifies Web3 development incentives through transparent, automated systems built on Base.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Building in public should be rewarded. ABC DAO transforms everyday coding into a game where developers earn $ABC tokens and Farcaster recognition simply by shipping code. No grant applications, no complex scoring - just stake your tokens and let your commits do the talking.

Our philosophy: **Ship code, get rewards.** Every commit counts. Every push gets recognized. Every developer wins.

## 2. TOKENOMICS

- **Token**: $ABC (v4 Clanker token)
- **Network**: Base Mainnet  
- **Supply**: 100,000,000,000 $ABC (100B total supply)

### Fee Distribution Model

**Clanker Trading Fees**:
- **$ETH portion** â†’ Staking contract â†’ Distributed to stakers
- **$ABC portion** â†’ Developer reward pool â†’ Distributed to developers for commits

**Membership Fees ($ETH)**:
- **100%** â†’ Staking contract â†’ Distributed to stakers

**Developer Rewards ($ABC)**:
- Funded from $ABC trading fees collected by protocol
- Random rewards (50,000-999,000 $ABC per commit)

### Dual Reward System
- **Stakers**: Earn $ETH from trading fees + 100% of membership fees
- **Developers**: Earn $ABC tokens from trading fees for commits
- **Clear Separation**: $ETH flows to stakers, $ABC flows to developers

## 3. THE DEVELOPER GAME

### How to Join
1. **Connect Wallet**: Connect any Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase, etc.)
2. **Pay Membership Fee**: One-time 0.002 ETH payment to protocol wallet
3. **Optional Enhancements**: 
   - Link GitHub account to start earning $ABC for commits
   - Link Farcaster for community announcements and social features
   - Buy & stake $ABC tokens to earn ETH rewards from protocol fees
4. **Start Contributing**: All registered developers earn rewards for code contributions

### Staking Benefits
- **Earn $ETH from Clanker trading fees** (primary reward stream)
- **Earn $ETH from 100% of membership fees** (secondary reward stream)  
- Automatic WETH unwrapping for seamless reward distribution
- Passive income from protocol fees
- Build reputation on Farcaster
- No governance - just stake and earn

## 4. COMMIT RECOGNITION SYSTEM

### The ABC DAO Bots
- **Platform**: Farcaster accounts powered by Neynar API
- **Function**: Monitor GitHub commits from registered developers
- **Action**: Post achievement casts and distribute rewards via @abc-dao-commits

### Recognition Flow
1. Registered Developer makes a commit to registered repository
2. ABC DAO backend detects the commit via GitHub webhooks
3. @abc-dao-commits posts cast celebrating the commit (tags Farcaster username)
4. $ABC rewards recorded in database for future claiming
5. Real-time processing and reward distribution

### Reward Formula
- Simple: 1 commit = 1 reward
- Random reward amounts (50,000 to 1,000,000 $ABC)
- Current phase: No staking requirement (all registered members eligible)
- Daily cap: 10 commits max per developer
- All public repo commits count equally
- Future phase: Staking requirement for enhanced rewards

## Automated ETH Distribution

The ABC DAO protocol wallet automatically distributes incoming ETH daily at noon UTC according to the following allocation:

**Distribution Breakdown:**
- **25% â†’ Staking Contract** (`0x577822396162022654D5bDc9CB58018cB53e7017`) - Rewards for $ABC stakers
- **25% â†’ Treasury** (`0x18A85ad341b2D6A2bd67fbb104B4827B922a2A3c`) - Protocol development and maintenance
- **50% â†’ Protocol Operations** (`0xBE6525b767cA8D38d169C93C8120c0C0957388B8`) - Retained for gas, operations, and future distributions

**Automation Details:**
- **Frequency**: Daily at 12:00 PM UTC
- **Minimum Threshold**: 0.01 ETH (prevents gas-inefficient micro-distributions)
- **Gas Reserve**: 0.005 ETH maintained for transaction fees
- **Transparency**: All distributions announced on Farcaster with transaction links

This automated system ensures sustainable funding for both staker rewards and community development while maintaining operational efficiency.
