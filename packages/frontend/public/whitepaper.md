# ABC DAO WHITEPAPER
## Ship Code, Earn Rewards - The Live Action Developer Game for Farcaster

---

## ABSTRACT

ABC DAO gamifies open-source development by rewarding developers who ship code with $ABC tokens and social recognition on Farcaster. By combining staking mechanics with automatic commit recognition, ABC creates a sustainable ecosystem where developers are incentivized to build in public while earning crypto rewards and growing their reputation.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Building in public should be rewarded. ABC DAO transforms everyday coding into a game where developers earn $ABC tokens and Farcaster recognition simply by shipping code. No grant applications, no complex scoring - just stake your tokens and let your commits do the talking.

Our philosophy: **Ship code, get rewards.** Every commit counts. Every push gets recognized. Every developer wins.

## 2. TOKENOMICS

- **Token**: $ABC (v4 Clanker token)
- **Network**: Base Mainnet  
- **Supply**: 100,000,000,000 $ABC (100B total supply)

### Fee Distribution Model

**Clanker Trading Fees ($WETH + $ABC)**:
- **50%** â†’ Dev wallet (primary treasury/collector)
- **50%** â†’ Protocol wallet â†’ Auto-unwrapped â†’ Staking contract â†’ Distributed to stakers

**Membership Fees ($ETH)**:
- **100%** â†’ Protocol wallet â†’ Staking contract â†’ Distributed to stakers

**Developer Rewards ($ABC)**:
- Funded from Protocol wallet's portion of $ABC trading fees
- Random rewards (50,000-1,000,000 $ABC per commit)

### Dual Reward System
- **Stakers**: Earn $ETH from 50% of Clanker trading fees + 100% of membership fees
- **Developers**: Earn $ABC tokens for commits (funded from Protocol wallet's trading fee portion)
- **Dev Wallet**: Holds 50% of all Clanker trading fees as primary treasury reserves

## 3. THE DEVELOPER GAME

### How to Play
1. **Join ABC DAO**: Pay 0.002 ETH membership fee to bot wallet
2. **Link GitHub**: Connect your GitHub account via Farcaster miniapp
3. **Buy $ABC**: Purchase tokens on Base (Clanker v4 token)
4. **Stake tokens**: Lock $ABC to unlock commit rewards
5. **Ship code**: Code normally - all public commits count
6. **Earn rewards**: Get $ABC for commits + ETH from staking

### Staking Benefits
- Unlock commit rewards (must be staked to earn)
- **Earn $ETH from 50% of Clanker trading fees** (primary reward stream)
- **Earn $ETH from 100% of membership fees** (secondary reward stream)
- Automatic WETH unwrapping for seamless reward distribution
- Higher stake = higher commit rewards
- Build reputation on Farcaster
- No governance - just ship and earn

## 4. COMMIT RECOGNITION SYSTEM

### The ABC Bot
- **Platform**: Farcaster account powered by Neynar API
- **Function**: Monitors GitHub commits from registered developers
- **Action**: Posts achievement casts and distributes rewards

### Recognition Flow
1. Registered Developer makes a commit to any public repo
2. ABC Bot detects the commit via GitHub webhooks
3. Bot posts cast celebrating the commit (tags Farcaster username)
4. $ABC rewards recorded in database for future claiming
5. Daily batch processing prepares rewards for distribution

### Reward Formula
- Simple: 1 commit = 1 reward
- Random reward amounts (50,000 to 1,000,000 $ABC)
- Current phase: No staking requirement (all registered members eligible)
- Daily cap: 10 commits max per developer
- All public repo commits count equally
- Future phase: Staking requirement for enhanced rewards

## 5. REWARD DISTRIBUTION

### Developer Rewards (Current Phase)
- Funded by $ABC from Bot wallet's 50% share of trading fees
- Random rewards between 50,000-1,000,000 $ABC per commit
- Immediate cast announcements via @abc-bot with commit URLs
- PostgreSQL tracking with job queue processing (Bull/Redis)
- Real-time webhook processing with exponential backoff retry
- Future implementation: Smart contract-based claimable rewards

### Staker Rewards
- $ETH from Bot wallet's 50% share of Clanker trading fees (WETH auto-unwrapped)
- $ETH from 100% of membership fees
- Claim anytime from staking contract
- Compounds with more stakers joining

### Treasury Reserves
- Dev wallet holds 50% of all Clanker trading fees ($WETH + $ABC)
- Primary treasury for long-term project sustainability
- Separate from operational Protocol wallet distributions

## Automated ETH Distribution

The ABC DAO protocol wallet automatically distributes incoming ETH every 6 hours according to the following allocation:

**Distribution Breakdown:**
- **25% â†’ Staking Contract** (`0x577822396162022654D5bDc9CB58018cB53e7017`) - Rewards for $ABC stakers
- **25% â†’ Treasury** (`0x18A85ad341b2D6A2bd67fbb104B4827B922a2A3c`) - Protocol development and maintenance
- **50% â†’ Protocol Operations** (`0xBE6525b767cA8D38d169C93C8120c0C0957388B8`) - Retained for gas, operations, and future distributions

**Automation Details:**
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC)
- **Minimum Threshold**: 0.01 ETH (prevents gas-inefficient micro-distributions)
- **Gas Reserve**: 0.005 ETH maintained for transaction fees
- **Transparency**: All distributions announced on Farcaster with transaction links

This automated system ensures sustainable funding for both staker rewards and community development while maintaining operational efficiency.
