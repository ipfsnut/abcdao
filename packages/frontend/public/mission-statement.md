# ABC DAO Mission Statement
## Always Be Coding

## **Our Mission**

ABC DAO exists to **incentivize collaboration in the Farcaster ecosystem using appcoins** by creating direct economic rewards for developers who ship code and contribute to decentralized social applications in the > ABC_DAO ecosystem.

We believe that the future of decentralized social networks depends on sustainable funding models that reward cross-ecosystem collaboration and high-signal channels. Through our onchain rewards system, we help developers transform every commit, every pull request, and every meaningful contribution into tangible economic & social value across multiple Farcaster applications and their native appcoins, providing support to early-stage and junior coders who need that community to join and that incentive to keep going.

---

## **Core Principles**

### 🚀 **Always Be Coding**
We reward action over intention. Ship code, earn tokens. Join the community & learn by doing.

### 💰 **Direct Economic Incentives**
Every meaningful contribution deserves immediate financial recognition through $ABC token rewards. Stake the $ABC rewards you get by coding to earn $ETH, or sell it, or hold it--the choice is yours.

### 🤖 **Automated & Transparent**
Our system runs autonomously through smart contracts and GitHub webhooks. Join the DAO, add your repo, earn rewards & be part of a conversation about the best ways to build quality user experiences into robust web3 applications.

### 🌍 **Building the Farcaster Ecosystem**
We prioritize contributions that benefit the Farcaster ecosystem, especially infrastructure, tools, and foundational technologies that enable multiple applications and their appcoins to thrive together.

### ⚡ **Real-Time Multi-Token Recognition**
Rewards are processed automatically within hours of contribution, not months. When you push code, you immediately earn $ABC tokens. If you're working on a repo with additional incentives from a partner project, you earn those appcoins too. If you're an independent developer or if you are working on a FOSS project and you want to recruit others to help you build, you can offer appcoin rewards to incentivize contributions on PR approval. 

## **What We Do**

- **Smart Rewards**: AI-enhanced commit parsing with priority tags, ecosystem impact analysis, and milestone bonuses *Coming Soon*
