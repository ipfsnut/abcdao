## Technical Implementation Details

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Backend Service
NEYNAR_API_KEY=xxx
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=xxx
DATABASE_URL=xxx
BOT_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=xxx
ABC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=xxx
STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=xxx
TREASURY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=xxx

# Frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEYNAR_CLIENT_ID=xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_ABC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=xxx
```

### Backend Service Architecture
```
GitHub Webhook â†’ Validate Commit â†’ Check User Eligibility â†’ 
Send ABC Reward â†’ Post Farcaster Cast â†’ Update Database
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  farcaster_fid INTEGER UNIQUE,
  farcaster_username VARCHAR(255),
  github_username VARCHAR(255),
  wallet_address VARCHAR(42),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE commits (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  commit_hash VARCHAR(40),
  repository VARCHAR(255),
  commit_message TEXT,
  reward_amount DECIMAL(18,2),
  cast_url VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE daily_stats (
  user_id INTEGER,
  date DATE,
  commit_count INTEGER,
  total_rewards DECIMAL(18,2),
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, date)
);
```

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Rate limiting on webhook endpoints
- [ ] Commit hash verification to prevent replays
- [ ] Bot wallet security (multi-sig recommended)
- [ ] User verification through Farcaster signatures
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints

### Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Treasury balance tracking
- [ ] Daily active developers
- [ ] Commit volume metrics
- [ ] Reward distribution analytics
- [ ] Bot posting success rates
